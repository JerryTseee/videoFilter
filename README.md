# videoFilter
implemented a filter effect by using OpenCV  
  
# Prerequisites  
Python 3.x  
OpenCV (cv2) library  
  
# Features  
In this section, you can list the key features of your Real-Time Filter script. For example:  
Real-time face, eye, and nose detection using Haar cascades.  
Overlay virtual glasses on detected eyes.  
Overlay a virtual mustache on detected noses.  
Adjustable sensitivity parameters for detection.  
Customizable filters with your own overlay images.  
  
# Acknowledgments
This script is based on the OpenCV library and utilizes the Haar cascade classifiers for face, eye, and nose detection.  
The sample overlay images for glasses and mustache are from the OpenCV repository.
